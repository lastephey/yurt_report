# yurt_report

project for fun to send a tweet when one of my cats goes in their yurt

tweets and data can be found at https://twitter.com/yurt_report

using a raspberry pi and a force sensor to decide when a cat goes inside

mining the twitter data, processing it, and tweeting the yurt report daily!

force sensor construction based on https://acaird.github.io/computers/2015/01/07/raspberry-pi-fsr

using tweepy library which isn't copied here, but you can find it at:
